                Our Story
              </h2>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Founded in the heart of Hampshire, Royalau is a family-owned
                business with a passion for creating luxurious and sustainable
                garden furniture. Our journey began with a simple idea: to
                design outdoor furniture that combines elegance, comfort, and
                durability. Over the years, weve grown from a small workshop to
                a renowned brand, known for our commitment to craftsmanship and
                quality.

              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
                At Royalau, we believe that your outdoor space should be a
                reflection of your style and a place where you can unwind and
                enjoy natures beauty. Thats why every piece of furniture we
                create is meticulously crafted using the finest materials,
                ensuring it stands the test of time while providing unparalleled
                comfort.
